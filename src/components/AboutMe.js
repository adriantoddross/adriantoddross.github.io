        Yo Adrian, I did it!

        Hey there! I'm Adrian, a full stack developer and graphic designer living in Atlanta, Georgia.

        I have experience building and deploying web apps and working collaboratively through pair programming and alongside project teams. I mostly work with NodeJS and React JS, using tools like Travis CI, Heroku and Netlify for testing and deployment. I care a lot about accessibility, semantic code, and user experience.

        I spend my free time playing video games, listening to podcasts, and enjoying the company of my wife (and my fur babies!). I dabble in a lot of creative hobbies like audio engineering, recording & producing music, and streaming video games.

        Currently, I'm looking for a full-time job. Feel free to email me with any opportunties.
