        Hey there! I'm Adrian, a full stack developer and graphic designer living in Atlanta, Georgia.

        I have experience building and deploying web apps and working collaboratively through pair programming and alongside project teams.

        I spend my free time playing video games, listening to podcasts, and enjoying the company of my wife (and my fur babies!). I dabbled in a lot of creative hobbies like audio engineering, recording & producing music, streaming video games. If I'm not laughing, I'm trying to figure out

        Currently, I'm looking for employment and freelance opportunities. Feel free to email me.
